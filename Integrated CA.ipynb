    "A recomendation system in online retail has the purpose to suggest customers or users what services or products they would be interested to purchase, adquire, or buy according to previous data like previous sells, categories of the products, streaming services, demographics, age, among others are analyzed creating the recommendation system using Machine Learning Models that predicts what are the interests of the customers and give us the option to offer it to them. For example, when you buy clothes in Shein, after you buy them, you got new recommendation clothers according to what you bought previously and what are the tendencies that other people bought when they selected the same product you choose and this new recommendations come because Machine Learning is implemented in many companies to save time to customers and also give offers that the customer could be interested."

Although Mean Rating Filtering shows a better result, I trust and decide to use in this case the weighted Mean Score since due to the use of cosine similarity we can compare between users according to the preferences of other readers and captures the reader behaviour. As the weighted model is lower than the baseline Root Squeared Error metric, this is the one I trust more."
